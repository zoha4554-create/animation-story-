🔹 Story Summary
The presentation tells the story of a crow living in a dry forest who becomes very thirsty and searches for water but cannot find any. After struggling for some time, the crow finds a pot that contains only a small amount of water. Since the water level is too low, the crow cannot drink it directly.
Instead of giving up, the crow thinks of a solution. He picks up small pebbles from nearby and drops them into the pot one by one. As more pebbles are added, the water level rises. Eventually, the crow is able to drink the water, satisfy his thirst, and fly away happily. This proves that the crow is clever.
